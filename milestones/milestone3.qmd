title: "Milestone 3: Sea Ice Concentration Trends and Anomalies"
---
## Summary
In this milestone, I focused on analyzing sea ice concentration anomalies and trends for 2023 compared to a climatological baseline. This involved statistical analysis and visualization of anomalies.

## Key Objectives
- Compare 2023 sea ice concentration with the 2006-2020 climatology
- Identify and visualize significant anomalies and trends for 2023
- Perform a statistical analysis to detect significant changes

## Tasks and Methods
- Computed weekly climatology from daily data (2006-2020)
- Identified weeks with significant anomalies and visualized them using polar projection maps
- Conducted the Mann-Kendall test to determine trends

## Results and Findings
- Discovered significant negative anomalies in certain weeks, indicating reduced sea ice extent compared to the climatology
- Visualized the largest anomalies in sea ice concentration using Cartopy

## Challenges and Learnings
- Implementing the Mann-Kendall test for trend detection was a new learning experience
- Mapping anomalies clearly required fine-tuning of visualization parameters

## Next Steps
- Develop a machine learning model to predict sea ice extent in Milestone 4
