title: "Milestone 4: Machine Learning for Sea Ice Prediction"
---
## Summary
This milestone involved building a machine learning model to predict sea ice extent using an LSTM network. The focus was on using sea ice thickness and atmospheric variables as predictors.

## Key Objectives
- Develop an LSTM-based model to predict monthly sea ice extent
- Incorporate sea ice thickness data into the model
- Evaluate the performance of the model on historical data

## Tasks and Methods
- Preprocessed the sea ice thickness data and merged it with other predictors
- Implemented an LSTM network with an attention mechanism for better feature selection
- Evaluated the model's performance on a holdout dataset

## Results and Findings
- Successfully developed and trained the LSTM model to predict sea ice extent with a 1-month lead time
- The model captured significant trends in sea ice extent, although further tuning is needed for improved accuracy.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Preprocessing large datasets for machine learning posed challenges in ensuring consistency across variables
- Implementing the attention mechanism was particularly useful for focusing on relevant features

## Next Steps
- Finalize the model and present findings to the team
- Deploy the project and publish results on the project website
