title: "Milestone 1: Foundations of Satellite Data"
---

## Summary
In this milestone, I focused on learning the foundational tools and methodologies for working with satellite data. I explored key satellite datasets and became proficient in accessing and manipulating this data.

## Key Objectives
- Learn to access satellite data through the ERDDAP data server
- Develop skills in using Python for data manipulation
- Understand the basics of sea ice data and its applications

## Tasks and Methods
- Accessed and explored the NOAA/NSIDC sea ice concentration dataset
- Developed Python scripts using the xarray library to handle and manipulate large datasets
- Documented the process in a Jupyter notebook, including tutorials and examples

## Results and Findings
- Successfully accessed sea ice data
- Gained insights into the seasonal variability of sea ice properties from 1978 to present

## Challenges and Learnings
- It was challenging to process the large datasets efficiently on my local machine.
- Learning xarray and ERDDAP was a critical part of this milestone.

## Next Steps
- Move on to visualizing and analyzing the sea ice concentration data in more detail in Milestone 2
