title: "Milestone 2: Data Analysis and Visualization"
---
## Summary
This milestone focused on the analysis and visualization of sea ice concentration data. I explored spatial and temporal trends and developed visualization skills to present the data effectively.

## Key Objectives
- Explore spatial-temporal patterns in sea ice concentration
- Develop visualizations to communicate findings effectively
- Gain familiarity with satellite data visualization techniques

## Tasks and Methods
- Calculated weekly means of sea ice concentration for different periods using xarray
- Visualized sea ice concentration using Python's Matplotlib and Cartopy libraries
- Explored the seasonal variability of sea ice

## Results and Findings
- Visualized the changes in sea ice concentration for selected weeks across seasons
- Discovered significant trends in sea ice extent reduction in the Arctic

## Challenges and Learnings
- Handling the large temporal scale of the dataset and optimizing visualizations
- Developing clear, informative plot titles and axis labels to improve communication

## Next Steps
- Proceed to the analysis of sea ice anomalies and trends in Milestone 3
